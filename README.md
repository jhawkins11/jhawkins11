## Full-Stack Developer // React, Node, Javascript, Typescript, Next.js, AWS

Hey there! 👋 

I'm Josiah, an innovative full-stack developer with 2.5+ years of experience. I love building web apps that are both visually stunning 🎨 and blazingly fast ⚡️.

My tech stack includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Next.js, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge by learning Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques to continuously improve my skills and deliver high-quality solutions. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball 🏀, reading 📚, and gaming with friends 🎮.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat code, collaborate on a project, or swap recommendations for books, music, or hiking trails. Cheers! 🍻
