## Full-Stack Developer | Crafting Smooth User Experiences 🧑‍💻

Hey there! 👋 

I'm Josiah, an innovative full-stack developer with 2+ years of experience. I love building web apps that are both visually stunning 🎨 and blazingly fast ⚡️.

My tech stack includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, and cloud engineering - I'm always eager to learn the latest tools and techniques to level up my skills. When I'm not coding, you can find me hitting the basketball court 🏀, getting lost in a good book 📚, or gaming with friends 🎮.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat code, collaborate on a project, or swap recommendations for books, music, or hiking trails. Cheers! 🍻
